# Haxe and PHP

![Haxe logo](img/haxe_php_logos.png) 

I use PHP target a lot, because the servers are cheap and my website is already running on PHP.

As most target with Haxe, they are poorly documented.
I hope this will help. If you think so, why not help with [contribution](contribute.md) to this tutorial site.

###How will this help me?

It will get you started with PHP **and** Haxe.
How to setup your project, install externs and how to work with them. This probably will never be a complete documentation but it will help you get started!

###For who is this?

For clever, cool and handsom developers. Duh! :D

* Probably for PHP developers who already started with Haxe.
* PHP developers who write more then a half a dozen classes.
* Flash-developers looking for an AS3 replacement
* Flash-developers starting with PHP
* Freelance developers working with PHP
* Small developers teams working on big projects  


## Documentation goals

I wanted to make contributing to this documentation as easy as possible.  
That's why I use Markdown; developers use it, but is really just plane English so **everybody** can write documentation!  
And this documentation hosted on Github, developers favorite place to store code.  
Even if you are not a developer and/or don't want to clone everything, you still can modify the files on the website (you need account to login in and change the `.md` files).


## Open-sourcing the documentation

I thought I was the first to try to write documentation this way, but other beat me.  
Although my idea was formed by writing a book in Markdown (Gitbook, but there are others).
Writing documentation is very similar to writing a book.
