#About loading a json 

A very common way of loading data in your web-app is the use of `json` files.

Haxe can handle [json](http://api.haxe.org/haxe/Json.html) crossplatform 

> Crossplatform JSON API : it will automatically use the optimized native API if available. Use -D haxeJSON to force usage of the Haxe implementation even if a native API is found : this will provide extra encoding features such as enums (replaced by their index) and StringMaps.
